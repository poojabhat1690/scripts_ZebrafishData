```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### this is a script that evaluates the counting windows created for the zebrafish annotation. 

```{r reading in the counting windows}

countingWindows_zebrafish = read.table("/Volumes/clustertmp/bioinfo/pooja/SLAMannotation/dr/output/final90percent/allAnnotations.bed",stringsAsFactors = F,sep = "\t")
countingWindows_zebrafish$V4[1]
countingWindows_zebrafish = countingWindows_zebrafish[-which(countingWindows_zebrafish$V4 == ""),]

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
